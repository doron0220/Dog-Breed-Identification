# Dog Breed Identification

Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

In this competition, we are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image classification, we will have to determine the breed of a dog in an image, out of 120 different breeds.

Here supplied 3 parts of my work: <br>
Part 1 - EDA and understanding of the data. <br>
Part 2 - Creating and training simple CNN From Scratch. <br>
Part 3 - Tranfer Learning using Xception pre trained model.<br>
